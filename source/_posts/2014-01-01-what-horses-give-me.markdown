People often ask what I find so fantastic with horses. So I figured I could spend my first blog post letting you know some of the things that make me come back to horses again and again. This is just some of the things that happened on a rather ordinary day in the stable, but no day is the same.

#### I get to work with my body
Due to the last days heavy raining the litter in Nemah's box had turned really wet and it could not be saved. So I removed 8 full wheelbarrows of litter mixed with shit and pee, and put in about 100 kg of new, fresh, clean litter. A perfect workout!  

#### I get practice in the art of saying no

Being a cat lover I take every opportunity to cuddle with the stable cat, Timon. Timon is a real cuddle cat and once you start to cuddle he really, really, really won't let you go. Eventually I had to tell him to stop walki all over me, drool and purr, even though he really didn't want to stop.  

#### I get my feet back on the ground

On occation the environment around the stable can give you quite a chock. This day I found this very local pile of snow. When I took a closer look I realised it wasn't snow, it was the remains of a poor hen that stayed out to late at night and met a fox. All that was left of her where these feathers. It reminds me of how short life can be and that I really should make the most of the short time I have on this earth.  

#### I practice patience

Nemah has had an injured hoof for the last 2.5 years and every day I have been washing it and making sure it's not muddy. For those of you that don't spend time around horses, they are true masters of making mud and then stepping in it. There have been times when I haven't been able to do anything but wash the hoof, so I have learnt that patience really is a virtue.  

#### I learn to see beauty in the smallest things
Even a couple of fence poles just lying on the ground can be really beautiful in the right light.

#### I get to enjoy the here and now
A ride with Nemah is always a pleasure. She enjoys a stroll in the woods just as much as a fast canter on the sand roads. The faster we go, the more her ears are pointing forward, a telltale sign that she is enjoing herself. But Nemah is also a very sensitive horse, with big ears and eyes. She can see and hear things I don't, thus making me stay focused on what we do and where we are. The perfect way to stay in the moment and let all troubles go.
